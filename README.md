Learning Log

Below is an explict list of moments I found to be noteable learning experiences during completion of the 30 Days of Streamlit "challenge"
- **Day 4:** I'd never used the `plotly` package before - I was familiar with `matplotlib`, from university coding, and I had some knowledge about `seaborn`, from some earlier Data Engineering projects.
